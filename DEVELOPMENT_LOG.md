# Development Log and Bug Analysis

This document tracks recent development progress and provides a detailed analysis of recent bugs, their root causes, and the steps taken to resolve them.

## Recent Development Progress

The project has recently undergone a significant push to implement a dynamic, interactive desktop environment and application management system. Key features implemented include:

1.  **Core Desktop UI:**
    -   Implemented a `Desktop` and `Taskbar` as the foundational layout.
    -   Created a reusable `AppWindow` component for all applications.
    -   Integrated Redux for robust state management of open windows, including their position, size, and focus state.

2.  **Filesystem & Context Menus:**
    -   Developed a backend "stable function" for filesystem operations (list, create, delete, rename) that operates on the `virtual-fs/` directory.
    -   Exposed these functions to the frontend via the Electron `preload` script.
    -   Implemented a fully functional right-click context menu on the desktop for creating new files/folders and on desktop icons for opening, deleting, and renaming items.

3.  **Application Management (App Store):**
    -   Created a system for discovering and installing external applications.
    -   **Backend:** Developed stable functions (`discoverApps`, `installApp`) to scan the `apps/` directory for available applications and create `.app` shortcut files on the virtual desktop.
    -   **Frontend:** Built an `AppStore` component that calls the backend services and displays a list of installable applications.

4.  **New Test Application:**
    -   Added a `simple-node-app` to the `apps/` directory to serve as a new test case for the App Store discovery and installation system.

## Bug Analysis: Build Failure (`Failed to resolve import`)

Following the implementation of the `AppStore` component, a persistent build failure began occurring.

### The Symptom

The Vite development server would fail to build the frontend, throwing an error:
`[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "..." from "window/src/apps/AppStore/AppStore.tsx"`

The specific path in the error message changed as different fixes were attempted (e.g., `../../services`, `../../../services`), but the core issue remained the same.

### Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental problem was a misunderstanding of the Vite development server's security model in the context of our project's structure.

1.  **Vite's Root Directory:** The Vite configuration (`vite.config.cjs`) sets the server `root` to the `window/` directory.
2.  **Filesystem Boundary:** For security reasons, Vite's development server is not allowed to access or serve files from *outside* its configured `root` directory.
3.  **The Conflict:** Our `services/` directory, which the `AppStore.tsx` component needed to import, is located at the project's root level, *one level above* Vite's `root`. Therefore, any direct relative path import (like `../../../services`) from a file inside `window/` would attempt to traverse "up" and out of the allowed directory, causing Vite to fail the import resolution.

### Attempted (and Failed) Fixes

1.  **Path Correction:** My initial attempts focused on correcting the relative path, believing it was simply a miscalculation. This failed because no relative path can escape Vite's security sandbox.
2.  **Barrel File (`services/index.ts`):** I created a central export file in `services/`. While this is good practice, it did not solve the root problem, as the import path to this file was still invalid for the same reason.

### The Correct and Final Solution

The robust solution is to use a **path alias**. This tells Vite (and TypeScript) to treat a special name (like `@services`) as a direct pointer to a specific directory, bypassing the relative path resolution issue entirely.

The fix was implemented in two steps:

1.  **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.cjs`):**
    -   An `alias` was added to the `resolve` configuration block.
    -   `'@services': path.resolve(__dirname, 'services')` was added, creating an alias for the services directory.

2.  **TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):**
    -   A corresponding `paths` alias was added under `compilerOptions` to ensure TypeScript understands the `@services` import path and can provide proper type-checking and autocompletion.
    -   `"@services/*": ["services/*"]`

With these changes, the import statement in `AppStore.tsx` was changed to `import { appStore } from '@services/index';`, which now resolves correctly during the build process.
