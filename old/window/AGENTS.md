# Agent Instructions for the /window Directory

## **ATTENTION**

The files within this `window/` directory and its subdirectories constitute the **core kernel** of this simulated operating system. They manage windowing, state, and the main UI shell.

**DO NOT MODIFY** these files unless you are specifically tasked with refactoring or altering a core system behavior.

- **Modifying these files can easily break the entire application.**
- Treat this directory as a stable, internal API.
- Application-specific logic belongs in the `/components/apps/` directory.
