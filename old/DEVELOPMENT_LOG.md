### **v1.1.0 (2025-08-20) - Code Style & Dependency Health**

This release focused on improving code quality, consistency, and developer experience by integrating a standard style guide and resolving dependency issues.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Google Style Guide:**
    *   Installed and configured `gts` (Google TypeScript Style) to manage code formatting and linting.
    *   Reformatted the **entire codebase** (`.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`) to align with the Google JavaScript Style Guide.
    *   Fixed dozens of pre-existing syntax errors and inconsistencies that were discovered during the linting process.

*   **Build & Dependency Fixes:**
    *   Overhauled `tsconfig.json` to be fully compatible with the project's Vite/React/Electron stack, resolving hundreds of TypeScript compilation errors.
    *   Removed the problematic `prepare` script from `package.json` that was causing `npm install` to fail by incorrectly triggering `tsc`.
    *   Ran `npm audit fix` and `npm update` to patch security vulnerabilities and update dependencies to their latest stable, non-breaking versions.
    *   The project now has a clean, reliable `npm install` process.

### **v1.0.1 (2025-08-20) - Initial Documentation**

*   **Project Overview:**
    *   Added a `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file to the root directory.
    *   This document provides a high-level summary of the project's purpose, hybrid architecture, guiding philosophy, and coding standards, providing a "global vision" for new developers and AI assistants.
